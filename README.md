# ImageBoard

<h2>Overview</h2>
Image Board is an Instagram-style, full stack, single page application, that allows the users to upload pictures to a general board, as well as comment on the pictures.
It is a site where anybody could go and post an image of their choosing, along with a title and a textual description of that image, and others could go and look at that image and make thoughtful remarks about it.
